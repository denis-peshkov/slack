# Slack RTM Bot and Web API Client

An initial start.

Project:
- The Slack RTM (WebSocket) Bot is designed for anyone to extend via extremely simple plugins.
- The Slack Web API client library provides a simple way to integrate your code with Slack.

Todo:
- Flesh out the slack rest client code to handle full set of methods
- Sort out default bot handlers
- Add error/connection handling to bot
- Documentation / examples
- Sort out dire test naming
- Add some integration tests - potentially via a manual runner
